# SpatialOmics

spatially_informed_nn_preeclampsia.ipynb is a python notebook containing a spatial transcriptomic analysis of data from Greenbaum and colleagues' 2023 Nature paper. 

Spatial transcriptomic data is used to inform a simple neural network to predict pre-eclampsia from placental tissue samples. Feature extraction reveals that T cell interactions proximate to vascular structures in the placenta are most important for informing pre-eclampsia prediction. 

This analysis provides novel insights to generate new hypotheses for the investigation, early diagnosis, and treatment of pre-eclampsia. With the predictive power of our model, patients could be informed of pre-eclampsia risk based on simple biomarker analysis during routine prenatal visits, thus allowing stratification of patient care based on risk of pre-eclampsia development.
